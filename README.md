# chameleon

A simple language mostly inspired by Rust. Chameleon is a language I made to better grasp LLVM and garbage collection. For the syntax I deferred to Rust because I find the syntax elegant and productive. My main complaint with Rust is occasionally fighting the borrow checker. Memory safety with peak performance is important in many domains, but Chameleon is meant for less performance hungry domains where the syntax and mechanics of Rust are still helpful.
